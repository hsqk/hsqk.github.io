- Most household appliances require direct current
- Laptop "power brick" is an AC/DC adapter; most electronics need DC
- Some motor-run appliances have an AC motor
- Suggestion for human generation:
    - flywheel + fixed gear (or even better, no chain; direct drive) + solid wheel (e.g. solid wooden disk, rather than spoked rim with rubber tire)
    - minimize energy losses, maximize efficiency
    - wheel turns shaft of permanent magnet DC motor, e.g. the type found in electric wheelchairs/PMDs; e.g. 12v
    - could possibly charge a battery with the output (deep-cycle battery? rather than car/marine battery?)
    - for electronics, consider just charging the appliance's battery directly if it has one e.g. laptop
    - for mechanical spinning things eg blenders, just move the thing directly, without electricity
    - need to keep pedaling to at least 12v worth
