>Economic rent is an amount of money earned that exceeds that which is economically or socially necessary. 

>Economic rents can also occur when certain producers in a competitive market have asymmetric information or else technologically advanced systems of production that give them a competitive advantage as a low-cost producer that other firms lack or are not capable of acquiring.

>As a result, economic rents are considered to be unearned.
